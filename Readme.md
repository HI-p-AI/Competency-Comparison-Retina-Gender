## Abstract
Retina specialists and researchers have been using color fundus photographs for almost 100 years for diagnosing retinal diseases, systemic disorders and recognizing humans. In 2018, researchers for the first time showed that gender identification can also be done by color fundus photographs using a deep neural network (DNN). Subsequent studies further confirmed the capability of DNNs in fundus photograph-based gender identification. However, the findings of these studies cannot be directly comparable with each other, since different datasets were used in different studies. In this paper, we conduct a competency comparison of six DNNs in gender identification by using a single dataset of color fundus photographs.
